# Design Assets (No Code Needed)

Designers only need to replace files in this folder with the same names:

- `hero.png`
- `bg_pattern.png`
- `icon_clock.png`
- `font_title.ttf`
- `font_body.ttf`

Rules:

1. Keep the exact filenames.
2. Keep the file extensions unchanged.
3. Return the whole `DesignAssets` folder after editing.

If any file is missing or invalid, the app falls back to default visuals and system fonts.
